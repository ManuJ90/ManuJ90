## About Me
At the end of 2019 I decided to make a 180 degree on my profesional career, I started with some internet courses and tutorials, and on February I sign up on a UX/UI design course, then I did an introduction course in front-end programming and finished with a Coding Bootcamp.
Now I’m looking for the opportunity to work in this industry, grow a professional profile and gain experience.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Did you know that in Australia there are approximately 50 million kangaroos, and in Uruguay there are 3.462 million inhabitants.
So, if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan would have to fight 14 kangaroos.
