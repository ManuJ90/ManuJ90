# Hello there!, welcome to my GitHub profile <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="25px" />, I'm Juan

## About Me.

At the end of 2019 I decided to make a full one-eighty on my profesional career.
I started with some internet courses and tutorials, and on February 2020 I sign up on a UX/UI design course, then in October 2020 I did an introduction course in front-end programming and finished with a Coding Bootcamp in 2021.

Now Iâ€™m looking for the opportunity to work in this industry, grow a professional profile and gain experience.

- Plataforma 5 | Coding Bootcamp
  - The Coding Bootcamp is an intensive three-month course where I learned the MERN stack technologies and the basic concepts to be able to develop web applications.
We work individually, in pair programing and in groups with the SCRUM methods, and the new EGG Education system, which provide us a real work experience during the entire course.

- Plataforma 5 | Introduction Module
  - Course based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it prepared me to the Coding Bootcamp.

- Coder House | UX/UI Design
  - Based on user-centered design and the mobile first philosophy, the course focused on the entire user experience development process, from Research, archetype research, interaction analysis and accessibility, to transfer them to the user interface, which is developed with the Adobe XD tool.
 
- Universidad del Museo Social Argentino | Law Degree 
  - Development in the legal field of the Argentine Republic, with high commitment in the defense of the Rule of law, in accordance with the contents of the National Constitution and the national, regional, and international legal order.

## What's next?

Well as we all know, the world of knowledge is infinite... so you gotta keep up...

First, I'm gonna deep dive my JS and React Skills, I really like them... 

Then I'm gonna dive into the Angular World because it's the framework by excellence chosen by fintechs ... and why not some Ethereum... the Crypto world is fascinating and it's changing the game... one is never ready

Don't know if I'm gonna be able to *master* those things but at least have an idea, a code to turn whenever I need, and try to do my best for the first job. :wink:

### Whe're almost there!!

Before you go, you can take a look at my repositories here, and the link to my small and humble projects.
Some of them were tutorial made, others where made during the Bootcamp, and the [**Conway's game of life**](https://game-of-life-manuj90.vercel.app/) was made with a frind of mine, `and it was super challenging`. 

Take a look:
- [**The Marvelous OMDB**](https://p5omdb.vercel.app/) | This one is almost responsive (I'm still trying to fix the alice-carousel...:grimacing: ) and uses glassmorphism in a nice humble and measured way.
- [**A nice To-do List App**](https://tododev.netlify.app/).
- [**A Beat Maker**](https://beatmakers.netlify.app/).
- [**Simple Weather Channel**](https://weatherchannelplat.netlify.app/) | Yup, preatty simple... 
- [**A Color Game**](https://pickcolorgameplat.netlify.app/) | Well... :sweat_smile: you have to guess the RGB color on the header...

#### Here's a fun fact... just in case you wanted more :wink:

*...Did you know that in Australia there are approximately 50 million kangaroos, and in Uruguay there are 3.462 million inhabitants.
So, if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan would have to fight 14 kangaroos.*

Ok... now you're free to go...

Thanks for stopping by!
