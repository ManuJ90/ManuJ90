# Hello there!, welcome to my GitHub profile <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="25px" />, I'm Juan

## About Me.

At the end of 2019 I decided to make a full one-eighty on my profesional career.
I started with some internet courses and tutorials, and on February 2020 I sign up on a UX/UI design course, then in October 2020 I did an introduction course in front-end programming and finished a Coding Bootcamp in 2021.

Now Iâ€™m looking for the opportunity to work in this industry, grow a professional profile and gain experience.

### We're almost there!!

Before you go, you can take a look at my repositories here, and the link to my small and humble projects.
Some of them were tutorial made, others where made during the Bootcamp, and the [**Conway's game of life**](https://game-of-life-manuj90.vercel.app/) was made with a friend of mine, `and it was super challenging`.

Take a look:
- [**The Marvelous OMDB**](https://p5omdb.vercel.app/) | This one is almost responsive (I'm still trying to fix the alice-carousel...:grimacing: ) and uses glassmorphism in a nice humble and measured way.
- [**A nice To-do List App**](https://tododev.netlify.app/).
- [**A Beat Maker**](https://beatmakers.netlify.app/).
- [**Simple Weather Channel**](https://weatherchannelplat.netlify.app/) | Yup, preatty simple... 
- [**A Color Game**](https://pickcolorgameplat.netlify.app/) | Well... :sweat_smile: you have to guess the RGB color on the header...

#### Here's a fun fact... just in case you wanted more :wink:

*...Did you know that in Australia there are approximately 50 million kangaroos, and in Uruguay there are 3.462 million inhabitants.
So, if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan would have to fight 14 kangaroos.*

Ok... now you're free to go...

Thanks for stopping by!
